=== WHEN DEBUGGING AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS RUNNING THE GAME, CLOSED DEBUGGING LOOP FOR AN AGENT ===

your task will be to remain an independent researcher of this issue. you will, on your own, investigate, make changes, build and run the game and then check the outputs, in a closed loop, until you fix the issue. 
The output will consist of runtime logs and generated output images. You will use / implement a screen-capture feature, where we output the screen contents to an image. 
That will let you perform visual verification. For the game runtime to progress to where we want, we implement debug skips / "jump to the part we care about automatically", so no input is needed in the game itself. Good luck.
